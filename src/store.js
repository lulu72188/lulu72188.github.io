<p>When you come through the doors of <span class='hint1'>Holy Trinity</span>, a <span class='hint2'>middle-aged</span> priest at the other end of the nave sees you and <span class='hint2'>strides down the center aisle</span> to greet you. "Good afternoon," he says warmly. "I'm <span class='hint1'>Msgr. Thurman</span>--like the actress in <span class='hint1'><i>Pulp Fiction</i></span>," he explains. "Can I help you?"</p>

<p>You explain your investigation, and his face falls; he leads you into his office. He sets aside a book about the first <span class='hint1'>Pope Gregory</span> ("Reading about the chants," he explains) and takes a seat behind his desk, looking saddened by the news.</p>

<p>"I'll miss him greatly," he tells you. "I remember when he first came here to ask how he could help. <span class='hint1'>Dame Fortune</span> must have smiled on us; he's been a pillar of the community ever since. Wednesday, in fact, he came to drop off some papers. Did you want to look through them?"</p>`,
